Recently I am practicing plotly to create interactive plots. 

I have created two figures that show how population and employment in Japan have changed over time for male and female and for different age groups. In each subplot, population and employment are depicted, in blue and red, respectively, for a particular age group. Figures are drawn separately for male and female.
